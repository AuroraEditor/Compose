## Aurora Compose
<p align="center"><b>An Open Source Feature Flagging and A/B Testing Built In Swift</b></p>

## Our Philosophy

The reason behind our cause for building `Aurora Compose` is to have tools that doesn't track users and is privacy friendly.

Products like `Firebase Remote Config` is all good and everything but tracks a user with unncessary data and is not super privacy friendly.

We want to give all companies and users the flexibility, privacy friendly and power of a fully-featured in-house platform without needing to build it themselves.

## Features to be include

- Feature flags with advanced targeting, gradual rollouts, and experiments
- SDKs for Java, Kotlin, C#, Swift, Javascript and Typescript
- Powerful A/B test analysis with support for binomial, count, duration, and revenue metrics
- Exporting reports as a Jupyter Notebook
- Automated email alerts when A/B tests become significant
- Managed Cloud Hosting by Aurora
